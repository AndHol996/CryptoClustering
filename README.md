# CryptoClustering

***
## Description
This is a program to prepare the dataset for analysis and utilize an unsupervised machine learning model to cluster the data, find the best k values for clustering, and evaluate the which features have the most influence on the principal components. 

## Project Status
The code is at a stable state. May revise the code in order to further understand clustering and its effects of the model.

## Conditions
The specifications for this program is that it is running on Python 3.10.14 for a Conda environment and imported pandas and the algorithms KMeans, PCA, and StandardScaler from scikit-learn.
